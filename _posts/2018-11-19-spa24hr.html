            Following a strong showing in the 2018 event, where the team ran in a top 10 position for
            much of the race, Majestic Motorsport will be returning to the <strong>Spa 24hr race</strong> in 2019.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-5">
            Having survived the abysmal thunderstorm during the night, the team emerged at dawn with
            the prospect of a strong finish. Particularly impressive given the rookie status of three
            out of the five drivers, who were racing for their first time at night, at Spa and in a
            24hr race! Unfortunately a fault with our refueling jugs saw us short of fuel on Sunday
            morning, and following a tow back to the pits the team recovered to finish P15/41 in class.

            As usual, our car ran flawlessly out on track all weekend, using only a half litre of oil during the
            whole meeting. Following inspection after Friday practice, the crew had changed the driveshafts
            as a precaution, as slight play was detected on the inner CVs.
        </p>

        <p>
            Because we carry an extensive
            stock of spares on our truck, including two spare engines and boxes, whole rear axle assembly,
            new Bilstein struts, shocks and club arms, as well as a full donor road car at race weekends, we're always
            able to deal with any small issues that arise during a meeting. In fact at Spa, we could have built a
            whole second race car from our spares, if our crew had been so inclined - we even had a spare cage!
        </p>
