        <p class="lead">
            If you're considering building your own car, it is indeed possible to get started
            and build an eligible car for around Â£3000. However, that really is the thin end of the
            wedge if you want to run a reliable car over a whole season.
        </p>

        <p>
            Our approach is to first run the donor cars we source on the road
            for a period, before considering them for our builds. And when we do strip down
            the cars, we remove more than just the interiors - all running gear is replaced with new quality
            brand OEM parts, and we have a supply of low mileage engines and gearboxes should they be
            needed for the build.
        </p>

        <p>
            We also equip all of our cars with quality seats and harnesses designed specifically for
            endurance racing, as well as completing the wiring for auxillary, ID and interior flood
            lighting not only to the regulations but with high specification weather proof quick release
            connectors.
        </p>

        <p>
            Following geo, it is time for a track test with our own drivers, who can bench new builds against our
            existing race cars.
        </p>

        <p>
            All builds are conducted at our fully equipped workshops near Kenilworth, West Midlands,
            where our sister company also happen to undertake <a href="https://www.majestic-motors.co.uk">high quality
            restorations of classic cars</a>. Those same quality standards are applied to our race cars.
        </p>

        <p>
            We'd be happy to build you a car for you to run yourself, equally we'd be delighted to run,
            prepare and store your completed C1 racecar for you over the season, so you can take advantage
            of the same convenience our <a href="/citroenc1arriveanddrive">arrive and drive</a> packages offer.
        </p>
