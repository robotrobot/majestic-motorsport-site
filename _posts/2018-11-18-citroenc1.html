        <p class="lead text-justify">
            The <a href="https://www.barc.net/championships/citroen">Citroen C1 Challenge</a> is a one-make series of endurance races ranging from 3 hours to 24 hours in
            length, contested by teams with up to six drivers per car.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify">
            The cars are first generation Citroen C1s (2005-2014) with a limited amount of allowable
            modifications, with control tyres and brake pads, to keep budgets reasonable.
            Although the cars only have 67bhp, they are fun to drive on (and beyond) the limit, and racing is close with
            the emphasis on driver skill.

            In 2018, the UK series visited Rockingham (twice), Pembrey, Snetterton, Croft and finally Spa in Belgium
            to take part in the famous 2CV24 race.
            Club racers take part alongside professional drivers from championships such as WTCC, BTCC & VLN.
            Notable drivers included Andy Priaulx, Alan Gow, Rob Austin, Dan Welch and Anthony Reid.

            In 2019, the UK calendar will be bookended by a pair of 24hr races, the first at Silverstone in April,
            and another visit at the end of the year to Spa in October time. The release of the other UK rounds are
            imminent.
        </p>
        <h4>Looking to take part in 2019?</h4>
        <p class="text-justify">
            For individuals, Majestic Motorsport will offer arrive and drive packages at all 2019 events this year,
            and will again be visiting Spa, as we did in 2018.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify mb-5">
            If you are a group or an existing team, Majestic Motorsport can either rent you a whole car for a
            weekend or even the season, or if you prefer build and run you your own car on your behalf.
