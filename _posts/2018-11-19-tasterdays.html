            If you're unsure whether or not <strong>Citroen C1 racing</strong> is for you, why not
            come along to one of our taster days?
        </p>

        <p class="text-justify">
            They're an opportunity to try out a car, get some tuition and meet our team, all in the
            familiar environment of a regular track day. You don't need any previous race experience,
            or a race licence, just turn up and let us guide you through your first steps.
        </p>

        <p class="text-justify">
            Up to four people can share the car on the day, and our instructors will be on hand to
            help you get to deploy all <strong>67bhp</strong> as efficiently as possible to the race track.
            Fuel, tyres, refreshments and light snacks are all included, and advice about how to start
            racing is free.
